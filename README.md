<p>This project is intended to demonstrate the use of Tailwind CSS and JavaScript to implement dark and light mode. The project utilizes the prefers-color-scheme media feature to automatically switch to dark mode when the user's operating system is set to dark mode. Additionally, the project provides a JavaScript toggle switch that allows users to manually switch between dark and light mode.</p>
